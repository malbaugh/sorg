## Tangible (#tangible)

* **<span id="macbook">[Macbook Pro 14" M4](#macbook):</span>** It's disturbing how much time I spend on this thing. Not only all day at work, but it's where the lion's share of my hobbies and entertainment comes from too. 

    * I've lived through many of the most important personal computing advances in history, and Apple's move to ARM chips yielded _the_ most important. So much power that a desktop PC isn't necessary, and so energy efficient that battery is never a problem. The MacBook Pro M4 base chip (non-Pro, non-Max) yields 24 hours of battery life. Incredible.

    * I like to carry a tiny [20W USB-C charging brick](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MHJA3AM/A/20w-usb-c-power-adapter) when going to work during the day. Takes ~no space and is enough to keep the computer charged.

* **<span id="canon-r6">[Canon R6](#canon-r6):</span>** Most photos on this site are shot with a Canon R6, which I've been shooting with for ~4 years. It's full-frame (a must) and uses Canon's RF lenses, which are admired industrywide. As good as smartphone cameras have gotten, I still lug this thing around because the detail and crispness of a full frame attached to real glass is that much better.

    * Despite that, I wouldn't give Canon more than a weak recommendation. Their software is awful, they make consumer-hostile decisions like that cameras won't charge over USB-C while they're turned on so that Canon can sell you a proprietary power delivery kit extra, and their claim of weather sealing on premium products like their USM lenses is extremely dubious (as I found out the hard way recently).

    * I expect to transition off Canon eventually, possibly by surrending and embracing the supremacy of our smartphone overlords, which seems inevitable given the rate of change over the last ten years.

* **<span id="kindle">[Kindle](#kindle):</span>** After about a decade, I started using a Kindle again. In the intervening years, smartphones have gotten bigger while the Kindle stayed the same. An iPhone Pro Max is the same size as a Kindle, and much heavier. Unlike iPad, I can throw a Kindle into any pocket for trips without thinking about the size/weight tradeoff). Modern models are USB-C and backlit.

* More Apple gear, which I love, but worry increasingly is stagnating compared to the Jobs era:

    * **<span id="iphone">[iPhone 16 Pro Max](#iphone):</span>**  Titanium, cool. Great phone, but I'd have to get pretty close to tell it apart from my previous 12, 13, 14, and 15.

    * **<span id="airpods-pro">[AirPods Pro](#airpods-pro):</span>**  Along with M1, Apple's greatest innovation in a decade. Practically everyone has these things now, but I'm giving them a call out because aside from maybe my laptop, they're the most commonly used piece of equipment I own.

## Intangible (#intangible)

* **<span id="vscode">[VSCode](#vscode):</span>** As a diehard Vim user I resisted for a long time, but finally had to concede: VSCode is the best software package written in a decade. Powerful, fast, and improved usability compared to a command line program, like making less frequently used features still accessible via GUI point and click.

    * Even so, the **Vim** extension is absolutely indispensible. Modal editing lives on.

* Terminal suite:

    * **<span id="iterm2">[iTerm2](#iterm2):</span>** A good terminal app for macOS. Highly configurable, and importantly, still supports non-native transition to full screen so that `âŒ˜-Tab` is fast.

    * **<span id="tmux">[Tmux](#tmux):</span>** A good terminal multiplexer that I've been using since time immemorial. A [short intro to Tmux](https://mutelight.org/practical-tmux) is one of the first blog posts I ever wrote.

    * **<span id="zsh">[Zsh](#zsh):</span>** A better shell than Bash. People tell me that I should use Fish instead. I tried it for a few days, but didn't find enough in there that I loved to justify the migration effort.

* Mac apps:

    * **<span id="alfred">[Alfred](#alfred):</span>** For opening applications, bookmarks, and performing basic actions (e.g. lock screen) with a global shortcut and a few keystrokes.

    * **<span id="ia-writer">[iA Writer](#ia-writer):</span>** For the first draft of anything substantial I write. No modal editing, making it easier to focus on writing over editing, and the best Markdown rendering ever devised (in which Markdown _stays_ as Markdown instead of being transformed to WYSIWYG display elements after it's written).

    * **<span id="movist-pro">[Movist Pro](#movist-pro):</span>** The best video player, hands down. As compact and energy efficient as QuickTime Player, but it can actually play more than a single combination of carefully encoded codecs. The UI is ultra-minimal and it supports Mac features like pinning to top.

    * **<span id="moom">[Moom](#moom):</span>** Keyboard-driven window manager. It's less comprehensive than a tiling window manager, but that's a good thing.

    * **<span id="notes">[Notes](#notes):</span>** For notes and todos. This app is absolutely awful, but it's ubiquitous, syncs nicely across all my devices, and is quick to access on the go, so begrudgingly, I use it.

## Dev stack (#dev-stack)

* **<span id="go">[Go](#go):</span>** I write more Go than anything else. I'm a critic of the language, but it's fast, compiled (and explicitly typed), reasonably productive, and has a lightweight concurrency model that works with minimal ritual.

* **<span id="postgres">[Postgres](#postgres):</span>** The world's best database. Incredible feature set, versatility, and performance. When used well, keeps data streamlined and consistent, and acts as an anti-bug firewall.

* **<span id="tailwind">[Tailwind](#tailwind):</span>** Everything about Tailwind feels intuitively wrong, but I finally embraced it after writing tens of thousands of lines of CSS over the years and in doing so concluding that it's unmaintainable at a fundamental level.

## Services (#services)

* **<span id="wework">[WeWork](#wework):</span>** This is an odd item to appear here, I know, but for years I've been a WeWork member under their $300/mo all access program. It's a well run service providing a reliably clean, stable workspace in dozens of countries around the world. I use it daily in San Francisco and have taken advantage of it as far away as London.
